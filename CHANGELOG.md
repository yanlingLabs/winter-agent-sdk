# Changelog

All notable changes to the Winter Agent SDK are recorded here. Versions follow the repo's own
`VERSION` file (bumped via `bun run version:bump`, synced via `bun run version:sync`); each entry
corresponds to one `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` commit.

## 0.0.11

- Fixed `provider-catalog`: every `zai/*` GLM row (4.7, 4.7-flash, 5, 5-turbo, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3) shipped
  with `reasoning: null`, so the continuity layer treated GLM as a hidden-reasoning source and
  classified a GLM -> GPT switch `warned-lossy`/`prompt: true` -- violating R-10b-8 (open models
  that expose raw reasoning, like DeepSeek, move without a prompt). Added official-doc evidence
  (`supported`/`readableState: full-exposed`, `continuation: plaintext`, `replayScope: all-turns`,
  `toolLoopRequirement: silent-degradation`) sourced from docs.z.ai's Deep Thinking, Preserved
  Thinking and Interleaved Thinking documentation, for the OpenAI-dialect rows only --
  `zai-anthropic/*` is left untouched (no official Z.ai documentation of an Anthropic-dialect
  thinking contract exists). This also fixes same-domain carriage: the OpenAI chat-completions
  adapter's `captureExposedReasoning` flag is gated on catalog `readableState`, so GLM's own
  tool-loop reasoning replay was being silently dropped.
- Added `provider-runtime` tests resolving `reviewModelSwitch`/`classifySwitch` through a REAL
  catalog registry (mirroring `winter-runtime-sdk`'s `defaultEndpointResolver` construction) rather
  than hand-built fixtures, covering GLM's reasoning classification and cross-family carriage
  (`<recovered_reasoning kind="exposed">` for a GPT destination via the live renderer, and via
  `toClaudeReady`'s step (e) for a Claude destination). Documents a finding for follow-up: `zai`,
  `deepseek` and `openai` all share catalog `provider.family: "openai"` (a wire-dialect grouping,
  not a vendor one), so `reviewModelSwitch`'s own same-family skip fires for any pair among them
  before the loss matrix ever runs -- independent of reasoning evidence, and not addressed by this
  release.

## 0.0.10

Cross-family same-session parity (Phase 10b, S1-S9): `message.id` on every assistant entry;
Claude-native compaction (`compact_boundary`/`compactMetadata.preservedMessages`) written and read
on both legs; the `recovered_reasoning` tag with a `kind` attribute (summary vs. exposed) replacing
the old `recovered_reasoning_summary` name; `toClaudeReady`'s pure transform; `switchFactsFor`/
`reviewModelSwitch`; `releaseSessionLease`.

## 0.0.9

Console bearer moved off the `anthropic:default` account.

## 0.0.8

Console-broker `ant`-only rework.

## 0.0.7

Console bearer beta header, `expires_at` normalisation.

## 0.0.6

Host-brokered Anthropic Console login (`console-broker`), bearer `expiresAt`, live-gate driver
fixes.

## 0.0.2 - 0.0.5

Early workspace scaffolding and versioning; no changelog detail recorded prior to 0.0.6.
